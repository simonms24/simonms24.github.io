      <h1>About</h1>
      <h2><strong>Simon Mejia</strong><br /><br /></h2>
      <p id="about_text">
        Mechanical Engineer
        <span class="expressions">(like Iron Man?)</span> with academic trainig
        at the FH-MÃ¼nster and the Universidad Pontifica Bolivariana
        <span class="expressions"
          >(those are a lot of words in foreing languages)</span
        >. <br />
        Passionate for computers
        <span class="expressions">(that's not mechanical eng.)</span> and all
        around them but with no (0) professional experience in IT... WTH, who
        needs professional experience when you have a lot of free time to learn
        about programming just by yourself
        <span class="expressions">(that's also not mechanical eng.)</span>.
        <br />
        This man <span class="expressions">(me)</span> has a lot of professional
        experience in Projectmanagement
        <span class="expressions">(WHAT?! that's so no mechanical eng.)</span>
        in the automobile industry
        <span class="expressions"
          >(finally something about mechanical eng.)</span
        >
        specially with electric cars
        <span class="expressions">(and not mechanical eng. again)</span>. With
        knowledge in the fields of assembly, production, product and process
        optimization, scrum/agile projectmanagement
        <span class="expressions">(booooring)</span> and video games
        <span class="expressions">(now we are talking)</span>. <br />
        <br />
        Beyond mechanical engineering and project management, I am a person who
        learns fast and loves to learn always something new. I don't like small
        talks <span class="expressions">(and I'm not good at it)</span> but I
        enjoy deep conversations. I like to drive my car and go fast
        <span class="expressions">(as fast as the speed camera allows)</span>
        and I spend lots of hours playing video games
        <span class="expressions"
          >(What better way to keep the mind working)</span
        >. I hate burocracy and bullshit talks
        <span class="expressions">(and I'm not the only one)</span>. <br />
        I am communicative, team player but lonely worker and goal oriented and
        more than a title I value and respect actions and character
        <span class="expressions">(#SimonForPresident)</span>.
